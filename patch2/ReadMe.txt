A Gif maker tool has been added that makes a gif, visualizing the calculated path.

Warning: 
whether user runs the exe file or runs the script, the running directory should be empty. 
otherwise, if there are png files or dot files they may get deleted.
This is because the script makes dot files named dotN.dot with N ranging from 0 to N. deletes them.
then, makes png files named pngN.png with N ranging from 0 to N. deletes them.
and makes a gif file named path.gif.
